    <h3>Optopus Image Classifer</h3>

    <p>
        This simple app will try to guess which objects are present in any images you upload.
</p>
<p>
        It works best if you clearly take an image of an object, such as a mug or TV screen. It is trained to recognise many different types of objects, and will give you a score between 0 and 1 which tells you which object it looks the most like. Give it a try and see what it can identify!
</p>
<p>
This page may take a few seconds to load, but once you can see the image of the baseball, try pressing the 'Choose Files' button to upload an image to the classifier. Please note that no information is sent off of your device - everything is analysed directly on your phone, so we will not receive any of your images. 
    </p>

        Upload an image: <input type="file" id="files" name="files[]" multiple />
